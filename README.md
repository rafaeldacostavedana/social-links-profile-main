# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

## Overview

This project is a solution to the Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal is to create a responsive profile page with interactive social links. I enjoyed working on this project, as it allowed me to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

### The challenge

The challenge required creating hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page. I used CSS to achieve this, utilizing pseudo-classes like :hover and :focus. I encountered some issues with accessibility, but I was able to resolve them by using ARIA attributes."

### What I learned

Nothing Special, I was just doing for fun. Is the first challange so I picked an easy one, just to test and recap the basics
